		<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-red-600 mb-6">Welcome to the World of Pokémon!</h1>

		<p class="mb-4 leading-loose">
			Pokémon, short for "Pocket Monsters," is a global phenomenon that has captured the hearts of millions since its
			creation in 1996 by Satoshi Tajiri. What started as a pair of video games for the Nintendo Game Boy has grown into
			a multimedia empire spanning video games, anime series, movies, trading card games, and countless merchandise.

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-500 mt-6 mb-4">The Pokémon Universe</h2>
		<p class="mb-4 leading-loose">
			At its core, the Pokémon world is one where humans and mysterious creatures called Pokémon coexist. These
			creatures come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny electric mouse Pikachu to the massive legendary whale
			Kyogre. Each Pokémon species has its own unique abilities, characteristics, and often, evolutions.
		</p>

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-500 mt-6 mb-4">Becoming a Pokémon Trainer</h2>
		<p class="mb-2">In this world, many people become Pokémon Trainers – individuals who catch, train, and bond with
			Pokémon. Trainers embark on journeys to:</p>
		<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">

			<li>Battle other trainers to test their skills</li>
			<li>Compete in Pokémon Leagues to become champions</li>
			<li>Complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive encyclopedia of all Pokémon species</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-500 mt-6 mb-4">The Spirit of Pokémon</h2>
		<p class="mb-4 leading-loose">
			While battles are a key component, the heart of Pokémon lies in the friendships formed between trainers and their
			Pokémon. The series emphasizes values such as perseverance, teamwork, and respect for nature.
		</p>

		<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-500 mt-6 mb-4">A Growing Universe</h2>
		<p class="mb-4 leading-loose">
			From the original 151 Pokémon in the Kanto region, the Pokémon world has expanded to include over 1000 species
			across multiple regions. Each new generation brings new Pokémon, new mechanics, and new adventures, ensuring that
			the world of Pokémon continues to evolve and excite fans of all ages.
		</p>

		<p class="mt-6 text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 leading-loose">

			in the vast and wondrous world of Pokémon. So grab your Poké Balls, choose your starter, and let the adventure
